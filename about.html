        <h2>What is ROCIS?</h2>
        <p>ROCIS (Reducing Outdoor Contaminants in Indoor Spaces) is dedicated to monitoring and improving indoor air quality in the homes and workplaces where people spend their time. Our Low Cost Monitoring Project (LCMP) provides participants with both indoor and outdoor air quality monitors along with expert guidance from our research team.</p>

        <h2>The Data Challenge</h2>
        <p>When using low-cost particle monitors for the first time, participants are often surprised when incidents like burning toast or cooking an egg cause dramatic spikes in readings. While it's important to recognize these events, they don't tell the whole story of indoor air quality.</p>
        
        <p>In one week alone, the three Dylos particle monitors used in the LCMP generate 60,000 data points for each site! The difference in indoor particle counts between participant sites can be remarkable‚Äîsometimes as much as a twenty-fold increase from one location to the next.</p>

        <h2>Our Visualization Tools</h2>
        <p>To help LCMP participants manage and understand their data, the ROCIS team has developed several powerful visualization tools:</p>
        
        <div class="tools-grid">
          <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>üìä Data Explorer</h4>
            <p>Advanced visualization with time range controls, data smoothing, and interactive filtering capabilities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>üìà Time Series Analysis</h4>
            <p>Color-coded line graphs showing particle count trends over customizable time periods.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>üéõÔ∏è Interactive Controls</h4>
            <p>Real-time data manipulation including decimation, smoothing, and series selection.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tool-card">

        <h2>Understanding the Data</h2>
        <p>Once you know how to interpret it, particle monitoring data tells a nuanced story about indoor air quality:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short dramatic spikes</strong> from cooking or other activities don't significantly impact overall air quality</li>
          <li><strong>Baseline levels</strong> and long-term trends are more important for health outcomes</li>
          <li><strong>Outdoor conditions</strong> significantly influence indoor particle counts</li>
          <li><strong>Interventions</strong> like air cleaners and exhaust fans can be measured and optimized</li>
        </ul>
